**Project Title: Uber Data Analysis Using Databricks and Madelina Architecture**

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on analyzing Uber's dataset to gain insights and build a data-driven solution using the **Madelina architecture module**. The goal is to process, clean, and structure Uber data in a meaningful way by leveraging **Databricks**' powerful capabilities for data processing and analytics.

The project involves creating **Fact** and **Dimension** tables to organize the data. The **Fact tables** store quantitative data like ride distances, fares, and trip durations, while the **Dimension tables** hold descriptive attributes such as driver information, locations, and time details. This star schema helps in simplifying the analysis process and improving query performance.

Furthermore, a **dashboard** will be developed to provide a clear and interactive preview of the current situation of the data. This dashboard will visualize key metrics such as ride volumes, peak times, average fares, and more, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on real-time data insights.

**Key Goals:**
1. Analyze Uberâ€™s dataset to extract useful insights.
2. Utilize Madelina architecture for efficient data processing.
3. Build Fact and Dimension tables to optimize data storage and querying.
4. Implement Databricks for data analysis and visualization.
5. Create a dashboard to present key findings and track current data trends.
